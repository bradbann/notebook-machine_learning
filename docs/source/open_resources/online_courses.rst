Machine Learning    
================    

Awesome open online courses for Machine Learning.

Get Started
-----------

- `Machine Learning @Coursera <https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning>`_
   
   About This Course: This course provides a broad introduction to machine learning, datamining, and statistical pattern recognition.
   Topics include: (i) Supervised learning (parametric/non-parametric algorithms, support vector machines, kernels, neural networks). 
   (ii) Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems, deep learning). 
   (iii) Best practices in machine learning (bias/variance theory; innovation process in machine learning and AI). 
   The course will also draw from numerous case studies and applications, so that you'll also learn how to apply learning algorithms to building smart robots (perception, control), text understanding (web search, anti-spam), computer vision, medical informatics, audio, database mining, and other areas.

Deep Learning
-------------

- `Deep Learning Specialization @Coursera <https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning>`_

   About this specification: In five courses, you will learn the foundations of Deep Learning, understand how to build neural networks, and learn how to lead successful machine learning projects.
   You will learn about Convolutional networks, RNNs, LSTM, Adam, Dropout, BatchNorm, Xavier/He initialization, and more.
   You will work on case studies from healthcare, autonomous driving, sign language reading, music generation, and natural language processing. 
   You will master not only the theory, but also see how it is applied in industry. You will practice all these ideas in Python and in TensorFlow, which we will teach.how it is applied in industry. You will practice all these ideas in Python and in TensorFlow, which we will teach.
