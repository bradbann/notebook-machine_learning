Calculus

Calculus is the mathematical study of continuous change.
It has two major branches, differential calculus (concerning instantaneous rates of change and slopes of curves),
and integral calculus (concerning accumulation of quantities and the areas under and between curves).
These two branches are related to each other by the fundamental theorem of calculus. 
Both branches make use of the fundamental notions of convergence of infinite sequences and infinite series to a well-defined limit.

Derivative
==========

| The derivative of a function of a real variable measures the sensitivity to change of the function value (output value) with respect to a change in its argument (input value). 
 Derivatives are a fundamental tool of calculus.
| The derivative of a function of a single variable at a chosen input value, when it exists, is the `slope <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slope>`_ of the `tangent line <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent>`_ to the `graph of the function <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_of_a_function>`_ at that point.
| The red tangent line is the best `linear approximation <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_approximation>`_ of the function near that input value as you can see below:
