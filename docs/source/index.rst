Machine Learning Notebook
=========================
.. note::
   In general,this notebook is divided into 5 sections.If you are a beginner, It is highly recommended to read the first four sections in order.The four sections are divided based on its difficulty as you can see below: 
      Phase1: Math Basis; Phase2: Get Started; Phase3: Step Forward; Phase4: Get Advanced;

   "Open Resources" section contains awesome open collections on the Internet;

.. warning::
    This notebook is under early development stage, it seems unavoidable to contain mistakes.
    If you find mistakes,it will be grateful to commit an `issue <https://github.com/lamdeyton/notebook-machine_learning/issues>`_ to me
    or contribute to correct them through `pull request <https://github.com/lamdeyton/notebook-machine_learning/pulls>`_.

Tom M. Mitchell provided a formal definition of the algorithms studied in the `Machine Learning <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning>`_:
    "A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E". 

I think the key of machine learning is to discover appropriate computable models through data training to solve specific tasks.
