| In statistics, linear regression is a linear approach to modelling the relationship between a scalar response (or dependent variable) and one or more explanatory variables (or independent variables).
| The case of one explanatory variable is called :ref:`simple_linear_regression`. For more than one explanatory variable, the process is called :ref:`multiple_linear_regression`.
| In Machine Learning, we apply the theory, take independent variable as input, try to fit a hypothesis function through data to predict the dependent variable as output.

Simple Linear Regression
------------------------

| Simple linear regression also known as "univariate linear regression", it is used when you want to predict a single output value y from a single input value x. 
| Let's start with a simple example, provide a dataset below:

.. csv-table:: House Price
   :header: Size (x),Price(y)

   2104,460
   1416,232
   1534,315
   852,178
