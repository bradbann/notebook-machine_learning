Python is an interpreted high-level programming language for general-purpose programming.
Python has a design philosophy that emphasizes code readability, notably using significant whitespace. 
It provides constructs that enable clear programming on both small and large scales.
With the help of a few popular libraries (Numpy, Scipy, Matplotlib),it becomes a powerful environment for scientific computing.

Matplotlib Tutorial
===================

Matplotlib is a plotting library. In this section give a brief introduction to the matplotlib.pyplot module, which provides a plotting system similar to that of MATLAB.

Plotting
--------

A simple example code for to plot a figure can be seen as below:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../src/plot_examples.py
